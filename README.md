This workshop is aimed at those new to writing client-side web applications using the ClojureScript programming language, a functional programming language based on Lisp and compiled to JavaScript.

ClojureScript and client side development are covered in a highly practical way, so you can evaluate where ClojureScript is useful in your own projects.

This workshop guides you through the basics of client-side web development and functional programming in ClojureScript.  Design approaches common to ClojureScript & React will be covered along the way.
