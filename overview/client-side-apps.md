# Single Page Apps

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluent user experience similar to a desktop application.

In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application, as can the HTML5 `pushState() API` .

Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

See the [Single-page application on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) for more details
