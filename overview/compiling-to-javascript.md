# Compiling to JavaScript

_Isn't writing in one language and compiling it into another language just adding lots of complexity?_

Most programming languages compile into another language and compilers have been around for decades.  Those compilers generate a language that is only meant for the computer to read, not the developer.

However, its a fairly recent trend (about a decade long) to use one language to generate another.  Today it has become quite common in the Javascript world

* CoffeeScript
* PureScript
* TypeScript
* ClojureScript
* JavaScript 6 and onward (ECMAScript 6 and onward)

> **Hint** Rather than call this compilation, generating one language from another is called Transpiling.
