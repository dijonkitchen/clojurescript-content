# Why ClojureScript

Why invest time learning a new language when we already have JavaScript and a new framework every week for all the client and server side apps we could ever want?

Its a very good question and its good to be skeptical about any new thing, and ClojureScript is still relatively new.  In fact many Clojure developers are a little skeptical about ClojureScript

This pales into the skepticism from the larger developer community

## Clojurescript is evolving rapidly

There are many great tools and libraries available for use today that make Clojurescript a far better experience than just a couple of years ago.

There are no signs of these advancements slowing down anytime soon in the Clojurescript community.
