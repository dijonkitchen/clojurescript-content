# Interactive workflow

One of the amazing things about Clojure and Clojurescript is the ability to get really fast feedback

Figwheel builds your ClojureScript code and hot loads it into the browser as you are coding!  As soon as you save changes to your Clojurescript code, those changes are hot-loaded into the browser, instantly changing the running Javascripts behaviour.

We will cover more on the Interactive workflow in the figwheel section.
